         <br><h6>Lorena Borjas, Transgender Immigrant Activist, Dies at 59, The New York Times, 2020</h6>
		<p>The artifact that is being broadcasted is an obituary clipping from the New York Times commemorating the life of Lorena Borjas,
		a transgender Mexican-American woman who died of COVID-19 in March 2020.  
		Lorena Borjas who migrated to the US in the 1980s and became a fundamental part of the trans community in New York City.
		Her work towards helping the Latinx transgender community, while at the same time fighting for herself because of her undocumented status,  
		makes her story an important addition to the Latinx experience in the US especially in 2020.</p>
		<p>This artifact challenges the homophobic and transphobic views that penetrate the Latinx community in US. 
		The transgender community has been historically excluded from the Latinx conversation and community.
		Therefore, allowing the obituary clipping from the New York Times commemorating the life of Lorena Borjas validates the Latinx transgender community who are often ignored. 
		Borjasâ€™ presence in the obituary is much bigger than just one person but of a whole community that has been neglected and killed. 
		Her obituary clipping from the New York Times will also shed light to all transgender people who have been killed in 2020. 
		This year has had the highest number of transgender killings. </p>
