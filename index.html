		<p>This exhibit, as part of the grander collection dedicated to 2020, helps to show the enduring 
		power of community, especially in times of immense pain and tribulation. From interstate bread 
		starters and international LGBTQ memorials to household birthday celebrations, communities have 
		helped people find a sense of unity, friendship, and belonging even during the year’s great 
		struggles, highlighted by the global COVID-19 pandemic and multiple celebrity passings. 
		On display here, you will find evidence of how communities of varying sizes consisting of members 
		of all backgrounds, ethnicities, and relations come together. These relationships, whether 
		long-standing, such as familial bonds or childhood friendships, or newly-formed, such as bonds 
		built on mutual respect of an individual or movement, can grow beyond their original meaning to 
		help create closure from losses or build strong connections that transcend physical barriers and 
		promote the success and health of their members. </p>

		<p>This is a page from a digital video diary of a 16th birthday party celebrated during the early months of the COVID-19 outbreak. 
		It is included in this collection, because it offers a glimpse into the ways families have been able to find joy and comfort amongst each other in required quarantine.</p>
		<p>This artifact was provided and described by Alohie Tadesse, who recorded and who can be heard off-camera in the video. She is a first-year MLIS student at UCLA, specializing in community and media archives.</p>
