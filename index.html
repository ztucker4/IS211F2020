		<p>This exhibit, as part of the grander collection dedicated to 2020, helps to show the enduring power of community, especially in times of immense pain and tribulation. 
		From interstate bread starters and international LGBTQ memorials to household birthday celebrations, communities have helped people find a sense of unity, 
		friendship, and belonging even during the yearâ€™s great struggles, highlighted by the global Covid-19 pandemic and multiple celebrity passings. 
		On display here, you will find evidence of how communities of varying sizes consisting of members of all backgrounds, ethnicities, and relations come together. 
		These relationships, whether long-standing, such as familial bonds or childhood friendships, or newly-formed, such as bonds built on mutual respect of an individual or movement, 
		can grow beyond their original meaning to help create closure from losses or build strong connections that transcend physical barriers and promote the success and health of their members. </p>
