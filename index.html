         <br><h6>Heaven’s 16th Birthday</h6>
		<p>
This video depicts a West Adams family celebrating a 16th birthday during the early months of the first COVID-19 pandemic wave in the United States. 
Many families during the early months of the pandemic did not have the same ease of access to grocery stores as they did prior to the pandemic. 
Some of these reasons include: because overcrowding at grocery stores, supply shortages at these stores, and countywide curfews put in place to help limit the spread of the virus. 
Because of these factors, viewers see a fragrance candle used in place of the traditional birthday candle typically put on a cake. 
Also, further into the recording, the camera pans to a hallway. This pan is motivated to capture the mother of the birthday girl who is off screen 
away from the festivities quarantining after possible exposure at her place of work. 
From audio, we hear the family singing in both Amharic and English. 
While it is not entirely representative of the hardships of 2020, 
it is a personal document of a 1st generation Ethiopian family managing to celebrate safely under the Safer-at-Home order. 
Ultimately, it is an attempt to carve out moments of joy in times of existential and financial precarity. 
This video is just one example of the ways families of various socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds have managed to adapt 
to the radical life changes brought about the pandemic and other tumultuous events from the year.

         <br><h6>Lisa Frank branded notebook (gifted) with contents pertaining to police/prison abolitionist texts
</h6>
		<p>This physical item, a blank college-ruled notebook, was a limited-edition release at Target stores, 
		a nostalgia-based resurgence of the popular children’s stationery and school supplies designer Lisa Frank from its height in the 1980s through the mid-2000s. 
		It was gifted to the recipient as a thoughtful token of congratulations for admittance into graduate school. </p>
 
		<p>It was gifted right before the need for a notebook arose: the recipient joined a reading and discussion group in June 2020, 
		largely as a response to George Floyd’s murder at the hands of police. This group was meant specifically for non-Black Asians and Asian-Americans 
		who were already in activist spaces but felt the need for a closer community now that activism was put largely online and to grapple with 
		anti-Blackness sentiment in our experiences in a new way. The group transcended to include collaborations and local actions, as well as a space for creativity and vulnerability.</p>
 
		<p>The notebook contains a table of contents in the front starting in August, and a few listings for the notes included, 
		the bulk of which respond to restorative justice practices and Angela Davis’s book, <i>Are Prisons Obsolete?</i>
		These notes correspond to conversations and their topics that occurred over Zoom on a weekly basis and continue to meet via this format. 
		The note-taking style corresponds to the exterior of the notebook: bright highlighters, stamps, and tape are used.</p>
 
		<p>This item is a juxtaposition of the garish playfulness found in Lisa Frank’s designs: 
		bright colors and whimsical animal characters as framework with more serious content relating to socio-political revolution on the inside. 
		Both of these themes, small instances of aesthetic joy and pressure to influence structural change, dominate much of 2020.</p>

         <br><h6>Screenshot</h6>
		<p>This screenshot (or digital image that captures the contents of a computer or mobile phone display at a specific moment in time) 
		of a Facebook Messenger conversation between a Danish man and his former American host student (an exchange student of high school or college age,
		who lives in a new country and stays with a local family as part of a scholarly exchange) captures the power of social media as a tool for connectivity, particularly during unforeseen times. </p>

		Facebook Messenger allowed the individuals in the above pictured conversation to instantaneously connect during the Covid-19 pandemic.
		Although they share updates with one another – as they typically would before the pandemic – they also share their individual experiences of the pandemic,  </p>

         <br><h6>Lorena Borjas, Transgender Immigrant Activist, Dies at 59, The New York Times, 2020</h6>
		<p>The artifact that is being broadcasted is an obituary clipping from the New York Times commemorating the life of Lorena Borjas,
		a transgender Mexican-American woman who died of COVID-19 in March 2020.  
		Lorena Borjas who migrated to the US in the 1980s and became a fundamental part of the trans community in New York City.
		Her work towards helping the Latinx transgender community, while at the same time fighting for herself because of her undocumented status,  
		makes her story an important addition to the Latinx experience in the US especially in 2020.</p>
		<p>This artifact challenges the homophobic and transphobic views that penetrate the Latinx community in US. 
		The transgender community has been historically excluded from the Latinx conversation and community.
		Therefore, allowing the obituary clipping from the New York Times commemorating the life of Lorena Borjas validates the Latinx transgender community who are often ignored. 
		Borjas’ presence in the obituary is much bigger than just one person but of a whole community that has been neglected and killed. 
		Her obituary clipping from the New York Times will also shed light to all transgender people who have been killed in 2020. 
		This year has had the highest number of transgender killings. </p>

		<br><h6>Kobe Bryant Memorial</h6>
         This piece by the Los Angeles Times signifies the way both the Basketball and Los Angeles communities came together to remember the life and legacy of one of their brightest stars: Kobe Bryant.</p>
		 <p>His tragic death on January 26, 2020 in a helicopter accident was unexpected and rocked the core of a city and sport that he headlined for twenty years. 
It features articles celebrating some of his greatest achievements at the times they occurred as well as his most testing and difficult trials. These moments were more than the actions of a man; for twenty years, Kobe Bryant held the captive audience of millions of Angelenos and basketball fans around the world, inspiring countless people to strive for their very best. Furthermore, it helps explain the power of community and togetherness in the face of tragedy, with mass tributes to Mr. Bryant not only showing respect for all the joy he brought Los Angeles Lakers fans, but also working to help those in mourning come to terms with what has occurred in a group setting. Pieces written by friends and coworkers struggling to explain or get a grasp on the tragedy that struck as well as others mournfully accepting the circumstances helped to remind all in mourning and disbelief that their feelings are not abnormal or unique; there were others out there that understood and felt the same way.

         <br><h6>Dehydrated Sourdough Starter</h6>
		<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting quarantine, many have found comfort in hobbies that can be done safely at home, such as baking. </p>
<p>Baking sourdough bread requires a sourdough starter, a mixture of water, flour, yeast, and bacteria that gives the bread its characteristic flavor. 
This is ordinarily a liquid mixture, but it can be dehydrated for easier storage and transportation.</p>
<p>This starter was prepared in Olympia, Washington by one baker and sent via the US Postal Service to another baker in Los Angeles, California. 
By reviving the starter with water and flour, the recipient was able to bake bread very similar to that prepared in Olympia. 
By using existing infrastructure to share their hobbies, these bakers were able to maintain a cultural connection and share their knowledge and skills.</p>
