         <br><h4>Dehydrated Sourdough Starter</h4>
		<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting quarantine, many have found comfort in hobbies that can be done safely at home, such as baking. </p>
<p>Baking sourdough bread requires a sourdough starter, a mixture of water, flour, yeast, and bacteria that gives the bread its characteristic flavor. 
This is ordinarily a liquid mixture, but it can be dehydrated for easier storage and transportation, essentially “pausing” the microorganisms that give the starter its life..</p>
<p>This starter was prepared in Olympia, Washington by one baker and sent via the US Postal Service to another baker in Los Angeles, California. 
By reviving the starter with water and flour, the recipient was able to bake bread very similar to that prepared in Olympia. 
By using existing infrastructure to share their hobbies, these bakers were able to maintain a cultural connection and share their knowledge and skills.
Despite the quarantine-enforced distance, the two bakers were able to strengthen their bond and use the sensory experiences of preparing and eating food to feel closer together.
