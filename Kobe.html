		<br><h4>L.A. Times Kobe Bryant Memorial Magazine</h4>
         <p>This piece by the Los Angeles Times signifies the way both the Basketball and Los Angeles 
		 communities came together to remember the life and legacy of one of their brightest stars: 
		 Kobe Bryant. His tragic death on January 26, 2020 in a helicopter accident was unexpected and 
		 rocked the core of a city and sport that he headlined for twenty years. </p>
		<p>It features articles celebrating some of his greatest achievements at the times they occurred
		as well as his most testing and difficult trials. These moments were more than the actions of a man;
		for twenty years, Kobe Bryant held the captive audience of millions of Angelenos and basketball fans
		around the world, inspiring countless people to strive for their very best. Furthermore, it helps
		explain the power of community and togetherness in the face of tragedy, with mass tributes to Mr.
		Bryant not only showing respect for all the joy he brought Los Angeles Lakers fans, but also working 
		to help those in mourning come to terms with what has occurred in a group setting. Pieces written 
		by friends and coworkers struggling to explain or get a grasp on the tragedy that struck as well as 
		others mournfully accepting the circumstances helped to remind all in mourning and disbelief that 
		their feelings are not abnormal or unique; there were others out there that understood and felt the
		same way. </p>
