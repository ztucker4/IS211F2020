         <br><h4>Quarantine Birthday Party</h4>
		<p>
This video depicts a West Adams family celebrating a 16th birthday during the early months of the first COVID-19 pandemic wave in the United States. 
Many families during the early months of the pandemic did not have the same ease of access to grocery stores as they did prior to the pandemic. 
Some of these reasons include: because overcrowding at grocery stores, supply shortages at these stores, and countywide curfews put in place to help limit the spread of the virus. 
Because of these factors, viewers see a fragrance candle used in place of the traditional birthday candle typically put on a cake. 
Also, further into the recording, the camera pans to a hallway. This pan is motivated to capture the mother of the birthday girl who is off screen 
away from the festivities quarantining after possible exposure at her place of work. 
From audio, we hear the family singing in both Amharic and English. 
While it is not entirely representative of the hardships of 2020, 
it is a personal document of a 1st generation Ethiopian family managing to celebrate safely under the Safer-at-Home order. 
Ultimately, it is an attempt to carve out moments of joy in times of existential and financial precarity. 
This video is just one example of the ways families of various socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds have managed to adapt 
to the radical life changes brought about the pandemic and other tumultuous events from the year.
