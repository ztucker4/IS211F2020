         <br><h6>Lisa Frank branded notebook (gifted) with contents pertaining to police/prison abolitionist texts
</h6>
		<p>This physical item, a blank college-ruled notebook, was a limited-edition release at Target stores, 
		a nostalgia-based resurgence of the popular children’s stationery and school supplies designer Lisa Frank from its height in the 1980s through the mid-2000s. 
		It was gifted to the recipient as a thoughtful token of congratulations for admittance into graduate school. </p>
 
		<p>It was gifted right before the need for a notebook arose: the recipient joined a reading and discussion group in June 2020, 
		largely as a response to George Floyd’s murder at the hands of police. This group was meant specifically for non-Black Asians and Asian-Americans 
		who were already in activist spaces but felt the need for a closer community now that activism was put largely online and to grapple with 
		anti-Blackness sentiment in our experiences in a new way. The group transcended to include collaborations and local actions, as well as a space for creativity and vulnerability.</p>
 
		<p>The notebook contains a table of contents in the front starting in August, and a few listings for the notes included, 
		the bulk of which respond to restorative justice practices and Angela Davis’s book, <i>Are Prisons Obsolete?</i>
		These notes correspond to conversations and their topics that occurred over Zoom on a weekly basis and continue to meet via this format. 
		The note-taking style corresponds to the exterior of the notebook: bright highlighters, stamps, and tape are used.</p>
 
		<p>This item is a juxtaposition of the garish playfulness found in Lisa Frank’s designs: 
		bright colors and whimsical animal characters as framework with more serious content relating to socio-political revolution on the inside. 
		Both of these themes, small instances of aesthetic joy and pressure to influence structural change, dominate much of 2020.</p>
